# Engine Data Logger
This program is designed to work with custom hardware to act as data logger and central control ECU for a 1983 Honda CB1100F.
It is written to run on a raspberry pi zero W and communicate with arduinos and other sensors to control and record various aspects of the motorcycle's operation.

This was originally prototyped in Python and later converted to C++ for stability and speed.
